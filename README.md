### Online Resources for learning python (from Learn Code Teach LA)
+ The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python - one of the best guides out there. It covers everything from installation to common modules and writing great code. It is highly recommended for novices as well as advanced Pythonistas.

+ Official Python documentation - this is the official documentation from Python.org. The Python3 docs are here. It is recommended that you keep a copy under your pillow.

+ Learn Python the Hard Way - a free online guide for people who want step by step tutorials for learning Python. There are over 50 exercises here.

+ The Python guide has a whole section on learning Python as well.

**Online classes**

+ **Learn Python the Hard Way.** This is the course (videos and PDF) that goes along with the online guide. Take a look at the guide and if you feel you would like a bit more then the course may be for you. The course is $29.
+ **Codeacademy.**  Codeacademy has a number of online courses available for learning Python.
+ **Coursera.** Coursera also has a number of courses.

**Online Videos**

There are great videos for both Python novices as well as experts.

+ **PyVideos.** The big Python conferences such as PyCon and Djangocon are recorded and the videos are made freely available.

+ **Getting started with Django.** This kickstarter funded video series is for people with some Python background who are looking to learn Django.

**Books**
Other than Learn Python the Hard Way (which is arguably a book) probably the most well known Python books are:

+ Python in a Nutshell by Alex Martelli

+ Learning Python or Programming Python by Mark Lutz
