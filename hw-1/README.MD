# Extracting Insights From Kickstarter Data

For this project, I analyzed a dataset of more than 4,000 successful and unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns using Excel.

Some of the charts that was created during this analysis are shown below.

**1.	What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?**
	
* 2015 saw the largest amount of successful projects that were on the platform.  In the data set, the same trend was seen for failed and canceled projects.  Why does the number of successful projects peak in 2015?  What was so special about 2015?
* The percentage that projects get funded is inversely proportional to the amount of money being sought for the project. 
* Plays are the largest category that seek funding on Kickstarter.  I find it curious that the amount of plays that seek funding on the platform is disproportionately more than the other categories.  What is it about Kickstarter that draws people seeking funding for plays to Kickstarter? Is it in the branding or something else?  
	
**2.	What are some of the limitations of this dataset?**

* This does not seem to be all the data available from Kickstarter.  Is this is representative sample of the data?  It’s strange that plays are the disproportionately more than the other categories.
* The data does not have any insight into the social media activity behind these campaigns.  I assume that there is a relationship between the amount of social media activity and the outcomes of the campaign. 

**3.What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?**

* The amount of projects that get funded as function of the month that they are posted.  Are project backers inclined to fund more projects in certain months/seasons of the year?
* The rate at which projects are funded.  Do more projects get funded at the start or at the end of the campaign?
* Is there a relationship between the size of the social media followings for the founders and the success rate of the campaign.  Meaning, does having a larger social media following increase the changes that a Kickstarter campaign will be successful.  Does the same hold true for people who have an email list?
* What is the distribution of projects by country. 
* What are the 10 most popular words used in the blurb that result in a successful/failed campaign. Does the word “help” help or hurt the campaign?
